# Windows Template Studio - VB Demos


This repository includes example VB projects generated by http://aka.ms/wts   
They are shared here for the purpose of gathering feedback. 

The nine projects here show examples of each combination of supported framework (code-behind, MVVM Basic, and MVVMLight) and project structure (blank, pivot & tabs, and navigation menu).
Each project also includes an instance of every page and feature option that's currently available.
